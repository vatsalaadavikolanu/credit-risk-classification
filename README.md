# Credit Risk Classification Case Study

This project explores how machine learning can be used to predict the likelihood of 
credit card payment default using customer-level financial and demographic data.

## Problem
Financial institutions face significant risk when issuing credit. This project uses
classification models to identify customers with higher default risk, supporting
data-driven credit decisions.

## Approach
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Data preparation and feature selection
- Multiple classification models
- Cross-validation and model evaluation

## Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Notes
This project originated from academic coursework and has been adapted and shared
for learning and demonstration purposes.
